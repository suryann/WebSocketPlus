This is a simple WebSockets library for C++

- Currently it is Windows only (it's pretty easy to add Linux support. Simply implement the LinuxSocket class.)
- There isn't any security challenge response processing, so do not use this library for production applications!
- Unittests are part of another prioritary application

Otherwise, have fun.
